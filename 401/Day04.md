# SQL database, ORM, Sequelize
#### What is SQL ?
<pre>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases
and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s. </pre>

#### SQL Command Types :
<ul>
  
<li>Data Definition Language (DDL) commands : are also called data definition commands because they are used to define data tables.</li>
<li>Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands : are used to manipulate data in existing tables by adding, changing or removing data. Unlike DDL commands that define how data is stored, DML commands operate in the tables defined with DDL commands.</li>
<li>Data Query Language : consists of just one command, SELECT, used to get specific data from tables. This command is sometimes grouped with the DML commands.</li>
<li>Data Control Language commands : are used to grant or revoke user access privileges.</li>
<li>Transaction Control Language commands : are used to change the state of some data -- for example, to COMMIT transaction changes or to ROLLBACK transaction changes.</li>
</ul>
