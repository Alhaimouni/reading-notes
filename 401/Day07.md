## The difference between Stack and Queue..
<pre>stack and queue both are non-primitive, linear data structures with so many differences in certain ways like mechanism,
structure,implementation and variants. But even though being different from one another,
they have a lot in common like storing the same data typeelements and with so many practical applications in real life. </pre>

### What is stack?
Stack is a linear data structure that follows the specific order to perform the operations. 

### What is Queue?
The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list.
