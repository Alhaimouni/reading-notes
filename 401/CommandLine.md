## What is command line ?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### What is Shell 
This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands.
##### Note :
There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell

<pre>Note :
When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys.
So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times.
You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.</pre>
