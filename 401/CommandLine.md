## What is command line ?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### What is Shell 
This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands.
##### Notes :
> There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell

> We can use  < echo $SHELL >
