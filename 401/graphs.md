# Graph

- What is a Graph ?
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Properties in Graph
Properties of Graphs are basically used for the characterization of graphs depending on their structures.

 
### The main difference between graph and trees is:
1. A graph is a set of vertices/nodes and edges.
2. A tree is a set of nodes and edges.
