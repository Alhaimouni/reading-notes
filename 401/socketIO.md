# Web Sockets 

<pre>WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application)
and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP
facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server.
This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first
requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open
Most browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.
Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device,
focusing equally on reliability and speed.
WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server
over a TCP connection
Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers.
It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.
Client-Side: it is the library that runs inside the browser using ***socket.io-client***
Server Side: It is the library for Node.js  ***socket.io*** </pre>

#### Key features of WebSocket
<pre>WebSocket helps in real-time communication between the Client and the webserver.
This protocol helps in transforming to cross-platform in a real-time world between the server and the client.
This also enables the business worldwide for a real-time web application to enhance and increase the feasibility.
The major advantage it stands over an HTTP connection that it provides full-duplex communication.</pre>

#### Why do we need WebSocket?
<pre>It provides full-duplex communication, which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
It also lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events to and from with negligible latency.
WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
It makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.</pre>

#### Key features of Socket.IO
<pre>It helps in broadcasting to multiple sockets at a time and handles the connection transparently.
It works on all platform, server or device, ensuring equality, reliability, and speed.
It automatically upgrades the requirement to WebSocket if needed.
It is a custom real-time transport protocol implementation on top of other protocols.
It requires both libraries to be used Client side as well as a server-side library.</pre>
